# pands---problems---2020

This respository contains problems designed for Programming and Scripting module using Python. 
Problems to be corrected in this include:
  BMI
  Secondstring
  Collatz
  Weekday
  Square
  Es
  Plots
  
  
BMI - This program calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in               kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

Secondstring - This program asks a user to input a sentence as a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. 

Collatz - A program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
          At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd                 multiply it by three and add one. The program will end if the current value is one.
          
Weekday - A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. 
          Had the days of the week listed as an object but changed to a tuple to make more efficient. Also added the output to include             the name of the day.

Square - A funtion to square numbers. This program contains two different functions that produce the square root of a number. The math            side of this problem was a bit tricky but I figured it out using code I found from different websites.

Es - A program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of a specific letter it contains. I wrote this program so that any            letter can be selected when searching a specific file.

Plots - This program displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes. 
        I found it tricky to get the three functions displayed on the same plot but figured it out by not calling the plots to show             until all three functions had been carried out.
