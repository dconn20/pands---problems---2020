# Damien Connolly
# Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer
# and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
# At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, 
# if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
# Have the program end if the current value is one.


Y = float(input( "Enter Numer: "))


while Y > 1:

        print (x)

     if Y % 2 !=0:
        Y * 3
        Y + 1 = x
        print (x)
